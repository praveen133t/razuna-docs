**How to setup Oracle with Razuna**

In this guide we assume that you got a working Oracle Server up and running or just installed one. If not, then please consult your administrator or [download and install the Oracle Database](http://otn.oracle.com/).

Razuna will setup all the required tables for a successful Razuna deployment within the "Razuna" schema.

> **Oracle Versions** : Razuna has been tested successfully with Oracle Express 10g, 10gR2 and 11gR1 on all platforms (including 10gR2 on MacOS X)

Since you got your Oracle Database Server up and running, let's just dive right into setting it up for Razuna.

___

**Razuna 1.4**

> As of Razuna 1.4 you only need to run the Oracle script. Razuna will configure itself for your database!

For users of Razuna 1.4 that want to use Oracle as their database all you need to do is to apply:

[Run the Oracle Database scripts](/db_connect/Run the Oracle Database scripts/)

___

**Razuna 1.3.5 and lower**
