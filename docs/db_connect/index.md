**Connecting Razuna to a database**

**Embedded Database**

The H2 database is the default installation and we call it the embedded database. Grammatically this might be wrong since H2 is a very powerful database server on its own and serves very well under heavy load. Still, we understand that some users might prefer their setup they have come to love and getting used to. Thus support guides for using Razuna with other databases are given below.

**Database Support**

**MySQL**

Support for the [MySQL database](http://www.mysql.com/) is available as of Razuna 1.1.3. We have tested Razuna with MySQL 5.0.45 but don't see any reason why it should not work with Version 4.x or the latest 5.1 one. Please let us know if you run any older or newer versions and run into problems. That said, you can find [detailed instructions on setting up Razuna and MySQL here](/database connect/MySQL/).

**MS SQL**

As of Razuna 1.2.5 you can use Microsoft SQL Server with Razuna. We have tested Razuna with MS SQL 2005 and 2008. Please let us know if you run any older or newer versions and run into problems. That said, you can find [detailed instructions on setting up Razuna and MS SQL here](/database connect/MSSQL/).
