In this guide we assume that you got a working MSSQL Server up and running or just installed one. If not, then please consult your administrator.

> **Important:** Make sure you create a database called "razuna" with a correct user and password that allows access to the database.

> **MSSQL Versions :** Razuna has been tested with MSSQL 2005 and 2008

Razuna will setup all the required tables for a successful Razuna deployment within the "Razuna" database with the schema "razuna".
