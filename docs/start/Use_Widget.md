**Use Widgets**

**Use Widget(s) to share assets**

> *Widgets are available as of Razuna 1.4.5. Razuna Hosted Platform customers need a PRO account to use Widgets.*

A Widget allows you to share your assets with people outside of your network. People can, according to the widgets permission, download assets or upload new assets. Furthermore, a widget has a thumbnail and a slideshow view. You can create as many widgets as you like for each folder/collection.

**How to create a Widget**

Within each folder and collection there is a widget tab. Within the widget tab you can add a new widget or edit existing ones. As mentioned, you can create many widgets each with their own settings.

> *For **folders** widgets are created for each folder. For **Collections** Widgets are created for **each collection** and not for each Collection folder. Moreover, only users with the "no restriction" permission can access the widget tab.*

> **Subfolder and content within** : *Widgets will show the content of your folder and all subfolders (including content). In other words, if you want to share a whole folder hierarchy you simply have to create a widget at the required folder level and all subfolders and their content will automatically be included!*

**Widget Settings**

Each widget comes with its own settings. You can adjust the settings anytime and it will take effect immediately. If you don't see a new setting being applied immediately, then please clear your browser cache!

What follows is a description of each tab of adding/modifying a widget.

**Widget name and permissions**

Enter a descriptive name name and description to identify this widget.

The permission settings allow you to make the widget;


   * **Public** (everyone can access the assets in this folder/collection)
   * **Inherit the folder/collection permission** (access permission is given according to the folder/collection permissions. If you set access for "everyone" then this will be the same as the "public" setting above. Otherwise your users have to authenticate with their name and password as set within Razuna.)
   * **Password protected** (enter a password in the password field and your users will be prompted for the password when they access your widget)

**Assets view, allow downloading and uploading**

**Thumbnail or Slideshow view**

You can choose to display your widget in a thumbnail view (this is the familiar view you know from the folders) or let the Widget create a slideshow for you.

When one clicks on an asset in the thumbnail view, a preview images is being shown (images), the video is being shown (videos) or the audio file is being played (audios). There is **no** preview being shown for documents!

The slideshow is a scrolling slideshow that takes all the images from your folder/collection. Obviously, the slideshow is only being created with **images** and does not consider other asset types in your folder/collection.

> **A word on the selected asset** : The thumbnail and the slideshow view need to know what kind of assets you like to show for the preview. Only the chosen format is being shown!

**How to select the proper format for the thumbnail or slideshow view**

**For assets in a folder**

Each asset has their own "sharing options". You can modify these settings in the detail view and select which format should be used for the preview or the slideshow. Only one format can be selected. Under the sharing options you can also set if you want the

**For assets in a collection**

Assets within a collection are shown in the "Content of collection" tab. For each asset you should select the format you would like to be shown for the preview or slideshow.

**Download original asset**

By default the downloading of the original asset is disabled (you can overwrite this individually in the sharing option) but if you want you can enable the downloading of original assets by setting the "Allow download of original".

**Enable upload**

Enabling the upload functionality within a widget will allow outside users to upload any asset to your widget. The upload function is the same as the one within Razuna.

> *There is no control of what the users will upload. It is best to **NOT** enable uploading on a widget with public access!*

> A collection widget with uploading enabled will upload its asset to the **Uploadbin** folder. Folder widgets will upload into the respective folder.

___

**Widget Code**

You have 2 options to let users use your widget(s). Either give them the URL to the widget itself or, if you prefer to embed the folder/collection content into your own site, grab the embedded code.
