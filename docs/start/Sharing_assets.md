**How to share assets in Razuna**

Razuna helps you to share your assets with people outside of your organization/team. There are two ways to do so; that is to enable folder/collection sharing or to create Widget(s) for a folder/collection (as of Razuna 1.4.5).

Where as the the sharing of a folder/collection differs from [Widgets](/start/Use_Widget/) is;

  
 * A shared folder/collection has **ONE** view (the thumbnail view). A Widget has the option of the thubmnail view or the "slideshow" one.
 
 * Access level to a shared folder/collection is either done with Razuna groups or public. A Widget has additionally the option to grant everyone access with the same password.
  
 * You can not customize the shared folder/collection view. Whereas a Widget can be embedded into your site/code (with an iframe).
   
 * Additionally, you can create as many widgets you like for each folder/collection. Each with their own settings.
  
 * A shared folder/collection has a basket and ordering functionality. Widgets **do not** have a basket or ordering function.

> We advise that you use Widgets to share your assets, as we will probably deprecate the shared folder functionality in a later version!
