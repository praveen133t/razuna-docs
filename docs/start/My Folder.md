**The "My Folder"**

**The "My Folder" and what it does and is**

The "My Folder" is a personalized folder that only you have access to (unless you give other groups access that is). The "My Folder" is being created for each user and you can store your own information within, just like any other folder.

Any asset that you store within this folder is also being indexed and searchable, but only to you! Other users, even users in the System Administrator group, don't have access to your folder (Of course, if someone has access to the filesystem or the database they would be able to read all assets and information).
