**Activate hosts with new settings**

Each time there is a new Razuna update you need to apply these changes also to each host container. In order to update your hosts you simply "activate" them with one single click.

Go to your main administration (e.g. [http://localhost:8080/razuna/admin](http://localhost:8080/razuna/admin)) and navigate to the "Add/Edit Hosts". For each tenant click on "Upgrade Host Settings" and AFTER doing so click on "Reset Host Cache".
