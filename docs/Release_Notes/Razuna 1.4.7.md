**Release Notes for Razuna 1.4.7**

**Important Notes for this release**

Razuna 1.4.7 brings one (1) major new feature, lots of enhancements and many important bug fixes to the 1.4.6 release.

**Labels are here**

The concept of Labels in Razuna is very similar to, say to the way how Labels work in Gmail. Labels are dynamic and can be assigned to any asset. In other words, Labels do all the work folders do and give you an extra bonus: you can add more than one Label to a asset. Once you've created a label, you can view all the items with that label by clicking the label name.

**Enhancements and bug fixes**

We've handled over 50 issues since 1.4.6, additionally to the new Labels feature, we have updated the application server (OpenBD 2.0), updated all Javascript libraries, updated the uploading tool to be compatible with the latest browsers (especially HTML5 capable browsers will see a major improvement in uploading). We also overhauled the design a big in some parts and tweaked a lot of code to bring you better performance. Additionally, we fixed a couple of issues that cropped up after the 1.4.6 release.

Overall, there are over 50 issues that we satisfy with Razuna 1.4.7.
