### Maintenance

We have 2 data utilities for user to clear the internal cache and data cleaner as below :

Flush Database Cache :
Razuna keeps an internal cache for accessing the database. If you feel that there is an error or have been instructed by us to do so, you can flush the cache for all the database caches with the button below.

Database & Asset Cleaner :
With the Database & Asset Cleaner we will run a script that tells you which records in the database have an asset on the system or if they are "lost" records (meaning they are zombie records with no assets assigned). You can run the cleaner utility at any time.
