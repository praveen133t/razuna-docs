**Backup & Restore or migrate from one database to another**

> *This option is available as of Razuna 1.4 and the new Razuna format as of Razuna 1.4.2!*

You have the option to backup & restore the complete Razuna database. This option will not only allow you to restore your complete Razuna server, but also migrate between different databases (say from MySQL to Oracle or MSSQL) with ease.

> The SQL and XML export are only for exporting your data. If you need to save a current state or migrate from one Razuna to another then you need to use the "Razuna format" option! This option does NOT backup your assets on your file system. It creates a restore point of your database records. You are solely responsible for your assets on the file system.
