# Groups

The User Management is only available to Users of the System Administrator or Administrator Group. You can add/modify users in two places, one time in the Razuna Administration and one time in the DAM section with the Administration link. Both will show you the same users and groups.

The difference is that within the DAM Administration you will also have access to other DAM related settings, like Logs, Scheduled Tasks, Custom Fields and more.

How to do it :

From the windows of Razuna DAM , you can click into your username from the right corner on top. Then choose "Administration" , click into Tag name : Groups.

Please see images as below :

From this screen , you can see the number of groups were listed and each group has an ID.

To add a group , you just key in the name of group to "Add group" field and click Add button to finish.
