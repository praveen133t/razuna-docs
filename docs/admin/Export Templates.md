### Export Templates

This is where we set the fields of assets which will be show in the user's folder.

Select the fields in each category which will be included in the metadata export. If no fields are selected in any of the categories then all fields will be exported.

(Tip: To multi select hold the Ctrl (Mac: Cmd) key and click on each value)
