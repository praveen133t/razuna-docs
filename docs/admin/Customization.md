### Customization

This section allow you to customize the look and feel of certain aspects in Razuna. Be aware that your SystemAdministrator might already have a customization configuration set for you. In any case, the settings below will always override the system wide settings!

Note: Settings will take effect immediately and should only be used if you know what you are doing!
