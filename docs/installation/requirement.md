# Requirement

Razuna is available and tested on the following platforms:

    * RedHat 4.x/5.x and later versions (includes CentOS) (tested up to RedHat 6.5)
    * Ubuntu 8.04/8.10 and later versions (server and desktop) (tested up to 14.04 LTS)
    * MacOS X 10.x and later versions (server and desktop) (tested up to 10.9.x)
    * Windows 2003/2008 R2 (tested up to Windows Server 2012)

Not tested, but known to work are;

    * OpenSuse 11
    * Any version of Debian Linux
    * Solaris/OpenSolaris


# Server Requirement

The recommendation for a server setup greatly depends on the usage. Rule of thumb is to have as much memory (RAM) available to the Razuna server as possible. You can run Razuna with 8GB RAM, but if you look into uploading 10'000 images or large images or videos the server needs to have enough ressources to "work" with the files. Configuring a Java application is unfortunately not a "fixed" thing and should be tuned individually. That said, our recommendation is a server with:

   * 16GB RAM
   * 3Ghz CPU

Storage depends on your deployment. But in any case, fast disk access will benefit the overall performance.
