# Server Requirement

The recommendation for a server setup greatly depends on the usage. Rule of thumb is to have as much memory (RAM) available to the Razuna server as possible. You can run Razuna with 8GB RAM, but if you look into uploading 10'000 images or large images or videos the server needs to have enough ressources to "work" with the files. Configuring a Java application is unfortunately not a "fixed" thing and should be tuned individually. That said, our recommendation is a server with:

 * 16GB RAM
 * 3Ghz CPU

Storage depends on your deployment. But in any case, fast disk access will benefit the overall performance.

**Plugins (optional) :**

**QuickTime**

The Quicktime player from Apple is being used for all other videos that the Flash Player can not play (WMV and some sort of strangely encoded movies that the Flash Player can not pick up). This means that Windows users will need to install the Quicktime Player from Apple. If you are watching Trailers from Apple's website you most likely have Quicktime already installed, if not you should go to [Apple's Quicktime website and install the plugin now.](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/)
MacOS X users should install the Flip4Mac plugin to be able to enjoy a error free WMV playback. Flip4Mac will install certain libraries for the Quicktime player and will make it possible to show WMV movies within the browser. [Flip4Mac comes in different flavors, but you only need to install the free version.](http://dynamic.telestream.net/downloads/download-flip4macwmv.htm)
