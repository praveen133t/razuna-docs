# Installation Guide

**Installation Consideration**

* Razuna has been successfully deployed on a number of operating systems. MacOS X, Linux (CentOS/RedHat/Suse/Ubuntu, etc.), Windows (XP/2003/7/2008) all work without problems.
* You will need a working Java setup on your system. Please refer to the detailed installation instructions later on.
* Razuna needs a J2EE server to run on. The standalone and Virtual Image downloads come already with a preconfigured J2EE installation (Tomcat) for you to simply start and get up and running.
* You will need at least a machine with 4 GB HardDisk space and 1 GB Ram for a "working" setup. That does not mean that any other installation won't work. It is just a suggestion.

**Razuna Server Installation**

Razuna comes with an embedded database and **you don't need to install any other database.** That said, it is possible to use Razuna with another database like MySQL, MS SQL, DB2 or Oracle.

Our recommendation is that you get Razuna up and running with the embedded database and once you are comfortable with it, you can use external database (though the embedded one is doing a great job).
