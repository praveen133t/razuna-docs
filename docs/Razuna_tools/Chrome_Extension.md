**Razuna Chrome Extension**

With the Razuna Chrome Extension you have a simple way to allow your users to browse the files in Razuna, download them and even upload new files within the extension.

**Installation**

All Chrome Extensions are hosted in the Google Chrome WebStore. Visit the [Razuna Chrome Extensions page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gliobkpjddpabnjilfghpnkghmigjjcn?hl=en-US) and click on "Add to Chrome" button. You don't need to restart Chrome in order to use the plugin. Once installed you will see the Razuna icon in the upper right corner.

**Options**

The first time you click on the Razuna Icon you will be taken to the Option page. This is because you have not set a "Razuna address" the extension should connect to. The Razuna Chrome Extension works with the [Razuna Hosted Edition](http://razuna.com/), a [Razuna Dedicated Server Edition](http://razuna.com/) and the self-hosted [Razuna Edition](http://razuna.com/).

Once set, click on "Save Options". You can then close this window and click on the Razuna Icon again. This time it will connect you to your Razuna instance and prompts for the login information.

If you need to edit your options again, just do a right-click on the Razuna icon and select "Options" from the menu.

**Usage**

In order to browse your folders and files simply click on the Razuna icon. If you haven't signed in, you will be prompted to sign in. This are the same credentials as your standard Razuna account. As a fact, the Razuna Chrome Extension is a stripped down version of the standard Razuna experience.

Once you signed in, a list of your folders is displayed. Clicking on a folder will display the content of the folder with your files.

In this list you will have the option to view and download each of your files. Additional you have the option to upload new files to this folder by clicking on the "Upload" link. If you want to view or download a file just click on the file name and the link(s) to the file and available renditions will be shown.

**Upload**

If you visit a folder and you have the required permissions to be able to upload files you will have a "Upload" link in the upper right corner. This will present you with the standard Razuna Upload Tool that you came to love. Simply drag & drop your files into the window in order to upload them to Razuna. Files will be available in the standard Razuna application and in the Chrome Extension.

(Unfortunately there is no way within the Google Chrome Extension framework to do this within the same window, thus the Upload link takes you to a new popup window).
___
**Search**

The Razuna Chrome Extension also features the same search as you've come to know from Razuna itself. The same options and search syntax is available, thus making the Razuna Chrome Extension a valuable partner in browsing your Razuna library.
